# Introduction
This is a repository mainly for demo purpose of computational geometry algorithms in progress. The content of this repository is inspired by [Prof. Yufei Tao's course](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~taoyf/course/5010/spr18/). It is likely that I will expand this repsoitory into a library for more general usages.
